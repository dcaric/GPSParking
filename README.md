This was a prototype project copied from one app related to a weather forecast :) that's why some files have strange names.
Idea was to show that it is possible 2011 to have simple and jet functional app which will require 2 clicks on the iPhone to initiate SMS payment for the parking.
Regrettably, the potential of this innovative concept was not recognized at the time. Perhaps, 2011 was too early for such a groundbreaking idea, at least in Croatia.
